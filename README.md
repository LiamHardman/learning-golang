# Introduction

## What is this?

This is:
- A personal repo of mine, that I've made public to document learning my first proper programming language.

## Existing experience

- I'm currently an AWS Cloud Engineer, and used to be both a Network and Linux Engineer. 
- The closest things to progrmaming I've done before is Terraform relatively extensively (in HCL) , basic Python for my Raspberry Pi, and some YAML back in the day for MineCraft server plugins of all things.

## Why golang?
- As a high-level language, I'd think it would be quite easy to learn.
- Most of the tools I use are written in Go, such as Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform.
- It's mature enough to have a good ecosystem, and learning tools.
- Generating a universal set of binaries does sound quite attractive to me.
- It seems a good mix of web-apps, desktop apps and infrastructure-related programs are being created here, so it is likely here to stay.
